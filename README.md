The large number represents the seconds, small is repitisjons.

## Description

It's a stopwatch that counts up and down by itself while counting repitisjons.
Time goes by differently while under pressure, so when training you tend to count faster,
so i created an app to help me circumvent this problem while doing exercises in the gym.

## Tech
* React-Native
* Expo
